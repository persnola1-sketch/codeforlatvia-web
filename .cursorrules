# CodeForLatvia Project Rules

## Language & Localization

**IMPORTANT: This website is designed for a Latvian audience.**

- All user-facing text, content, and UI elements should be in **Latvian language**
- This includes:
  - Page titles, headings, and descriptions
  - Button labels and CTAs
  - Navigation items
  - Error messages and notifications
  - Form labels and placeholders
  - Help text and tooltips
  - Any content visible to end users

- Code comments, variable names, and technical documentation can remain in English
- API responses and data structures can use English for consistency
- When creating new components or pages, always write the content in Latvian first

## Examples

✅ **Correct:**
- Button: "Sākt mācīties"
- Heading: "Kāpēc Code For Latvia?"
- Description: "Es izveidoju Code For Latvia galvenokārt sevis dēļ..."

❌ **Incorrect:**
- Button: "Start Learning"
- Heading: "Why Code For Latvia?"

## Translation Guidelines

- Use natural, conversational Latvian
- Technical terms can remain in English if commonly used (e.g., "API", "AI", "code")
- Maintain consistency in terminology across the site
- Consider the target audience (Latvian youth interested in technology)
