Fix: Remove ReferenceError bug and reduce excessive debug logging

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed critical bug in fetch-comments route: Removed undefined `savedRepliesCount++` references that caused ReferenceError when saving replies (lines 704, 720)
- Fixed TypeScript compilation error: Added proper type annotations to Map constructor for apiCommentMap (line 914-916)
- Fixed TypeScript build error in PublicCommentViewer: Converted disabled prop expression to explicit boolean to prevent type error (line 216)

## Code Quality Improvements
- Reduced excessive debug logging in fetch-comments/route.ts:
  - Removed verbose JSON.stringify dumps of API responses
  - Removed debugging sections analyzing comment structures
  - Removed individual comment logging loops
  - Simplified reply fetching logs
  - Kept essential error/warning logs intact

- Reduced excessive debug logging in fetch-replies/route.ts:
  - Simplified parent comment UUID lookup logging
  - Simplified Supabase reply fetching logs
  - Removed verbose skipApi section logging
  - Removed JSON.stringify dumps
  - Kept essential error/warning logs intact

- Reduced excessive debug logging in CommentCard.tsx:
  - Removed verbose request/response logging
  - Removed detailed comment information logging
  - Kept essential error handling logs

## Impact
- Prevents runtime crashes when syncing comments with replies
- Improves performance by reducing console output
- Better production-ready code quality
- No breaking changes - all error handling preserved

## Files Changed
- app/api/fetch-comments/route.ts
- app/api/fetch-replies/route.ts
