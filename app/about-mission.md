# Why CodeForLatvia

This project exists to help Latvians learn practical AI tools and implement simple automations in businesses and communities. Key reasons:

1. Economic resilience: Automation and AI can help small businesses save time and scale services without large upfront investments.
2. Skills uplift: Teaching developers and non-developers how to integrate AI increases employability and reduces talent gaps.
3. Transparent learning: By showing mistakes and real workflows, CodeForLatvia creates trust and a learning culture.
